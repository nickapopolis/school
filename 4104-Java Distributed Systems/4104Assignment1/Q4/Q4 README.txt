README For Question 4
=====================

This question was written in Eclipse with Java JDK 1.7 64-bit. In order to 
compile this project, you need to import this question into Eclipse.

The question is almost completely working. There is one thing that does not
work and that is the "before" constraint. Due to the way I implemented the 
thread-spawning algorithm, implementing the "before" constraint seems to be
very difficult and I did not have time to rewrite my code. The program ignores
all lines that have "before" in them in the constraints file.

For the Bayes algorithm, I was getting odd output and couldn't solve the problem.
The algorithm is in the Relation class in the function calculateClassification(). 
The covariance matrix calculation for optimal is done in the if statement if(isoptimal) 
and the calculation for naive bayes is done in the else statement.
